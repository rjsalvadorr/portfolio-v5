## Usage

- `npm start` or `npm run develop`: usual dev'ing
- `npm run build`: builds site for deployment
- `npm run build-serve`: builds site for deployment, then runs `http-server` for quick local testing

## Windows troubles

I've noticed some inconsistent/buggy/odd behaviour when dev'ing on windows:

1. Use Powershell/CMD when RUNNING the site locally! The dev process does not work on my terminal emulator on Windows 10. :(
1. Use a terminal emulator when BUILDING the site for deployment. I'm seeing buggy behaviour on build outputs when done on Powershell.
